Hello Subscribers,

Each newsletter is placed in a dir called "newsletters".
Every month the editor writes a new newsletter and places
it in the dir. When the php script is run, it reads the text
file and sends it as the body of the newsletter email.

Thank you for reading. Look forward to next
month's issue.

Editor
